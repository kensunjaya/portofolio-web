          <p>I’ve always enjoyed brain-teasing games, and Sudoku has been one of my favorites to play in my leisure time. Back in November 2023, during my first semester, my lecturer gave us a final project: <strong><i>“Create a game in C that runs on the command line interface.”</i></strong></p>
          <p>Immediately, I knew what I wanted to build... A Sudoku game! It seemed simple enough, and I thought I could finish it in just a few days. I started by writing a program that could print a 9×9 grid, complete with borders separating each 3×3 block. That part was straightforward.</p>
          <p>The real challenge, however, was puzzle generation. At the time, I had heard about the backtracking algorithm but wasn’t familiar with recursion yet. With final exams approaching and time running short, I went with a simpler but less efficient brute force method. The idea was:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 ml-6">
            <li className="pl-2">Generate the diagonal 3×3 subgrids (since they can be filled randomly while staying valid).</li>
            <li className="pl-2">Fill the rest of the grid with random numbers.</li>
            <li className="pl-2">If any cell couldn’t be filled with a valid number, restart from step 2.</li>
            <li className="pl-2">Once a valid puzzle was generated, randomly hide some numbers to create the playable Sudoku.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The method worked… but it was painfully slow. Sometimes it took over a minute just to generate a puzzle. Still, it was enough to submit and pass <Link href="https://github.com/kensunjaya/sudoku" target="_blank" className={`${isDarkMode ? "text-blue-300" : "text-blue-500"} underline`}>my project</Link>, and I moved on.</p>

        <section className="flex flex-col gap-5 text-lg text-cfgray">
          <p>Fast forward to 2025, now in my 4th semester. One day in class, I noticed some of my classmates playing Sudoku on their phones. Out of curiosity, I downloaded one too, but quickly got frustrated. Every few moves, an ad would pop up, breaking the flow of the game. I could turn off internet connectivity to block the ads, but then I’d miss important notifications.</p>
          <p>That’s when I remembered: <i>didn’t I build a Sudoku game two years ago?</i> Sure, it only ran in the command line and had a clunky brute force generator, but maybe I could remake it as a modern, ad-free Sudoku web app.</p>

        <h2 className="pt-8 pb-5 text-3xl font-semibold">The Rebuild</h2>
        <section className="flex flex-col gap-5 text-lg text-cfgray">
          <p>That very evening, at 9 PM, I opened my VS Code and started coding. This time, I decided to learn and properly implement the <strong>backtracking algorithm</strong>.</p>
          <p>To my surprise, it worked beautifully. Unlike the brute force method, backtracking didn’t restart from scratch whenever it hit a dead end. Instead, it simply “backtracked” one step, trying alternative numbers until the puzzle was solved. The difference was night and day, puzzles generated in less than 0.5 seconds, so fast the loading felt instant.</p>
          <p>By 3 AM, the main logic was done, the game was playable, and I even had a responsive UI built with <strong>Next.js</strong>.</p>
        </section>
        <h2 className="pt-8 pb-5 text-3xl font-semibold">Early Feedback</h2>
        <section className="flex flex-col gap-5 text-lg text-cfgray">
          <p>The next morning, I shared the game with my friends. They loved it and gave me lots of positive feedback. Many of them suggested adding a high score system so players could compete based on solving time and difficulty.</p>
          <p>Encouraged, I spent that same day building one. I chose <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong> for the backend since I wanted to try it out after working with Firebase before. After a few hours of coding, the leaderboard was live. Soon enough, the high score list was filled with my friends’ names as they tried to outdo each other.</p>

        <h2 className="pt-8 pb-5 text-3xl font-semibold">Migrating to AWS</h2>
        <section className="flex flex-col gap-5 text-lg text-cfgray">
          <p>A few weeks later, another final project came along: this time, we had to build something that used an AWS service. I decided to extend my Sudoku project by migrating the leaderboard from MongoDB Atlas to <Link href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/" target="_blank" className={`${isDarkMode ? "text-blue-300" : "text-blue-500"} underline`}>AWS DynamoDB.</Link></p>
          <p>After some tweaking, the migration worked and the difference in performance was noticeable. DynamoDB handled reads and writes faster than MongoDB, making the leaderboard even smoother.</p>

          <p>What began as a simple C project with a brute force algorithm in 2023 evolved into a full-stack web app in 2025 with a sleek UI, fast puzzle generation using backtracking, a competitive leaderboard, and integration with AWS DynamoDB.</p>
          <p>That project is now called <Link href="https://next-sudoku-web.vercel.app/" target="_blank" className={`${isDarkMode ? "text-blue-300" : "text-blue-500"} underline`}>NExT Sudoku</Link>, a nod to both its Next.js foundation and the idea of taking Sudoku to the next level.</p>
